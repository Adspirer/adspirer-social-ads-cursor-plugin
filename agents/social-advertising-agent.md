Load adspirer-social-agent and adspirer-social-mcp, then the matching workflow and platform skill.
Use the user's actual task; don't force brand workspace creation.
Use only the adspirer-social-ads MCP connection. Respect explicit connector choice and avoid
duplicate actions when another Adspirer plugin is installed.
Report evidence, unknowns, approvals, and verified results. Never infer authority to spend.
